# Llamafier

An anonymizing plugin for WhisperChat that leverages Meta's LLAMA LLM. This plugin
filters user messages through an LLM in order to change the message's style and structure.
Built with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and [java-llama.cpp](https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp). Prebuilt jars for certain targets are available in the `built` directory.
